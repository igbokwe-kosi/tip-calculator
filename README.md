## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Calculate the correct tip and total cost of the bill per person

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow

### What I learned

This was my first web page working with JavaScript without a tutorial video, so I learnt how to use Google to search for things I need

### Continued development

Would like to change the css to scss and use make class names. Also remove the bug that selects the 10% button when I press enter

### Useful resources

- [Make Tint and Shades](https://maketintsandshades.com/) - This helped me get a color palette. I recommend it ;)
